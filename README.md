This is Android App for performing experiments with [PSLab](http://pslab.fossasia.org/).

**PSLab** is a new addition to FOSSASIA Science Lab. This tiny pocket lab provides an array of necessary equipments for doing science and engineering experiments. It can function like an oscilloscope, waveform generator, frequency counter, programmable voltage and current source and also as a data logger.

## Code practices

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics. 

 * Single commit per pull request
 * Reference the issue numbers in the commit message. Follow the pattern ``` Fixes #<issue number> <commit message>```
 * Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
 * The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them and not the maintainers cherrypicking and merging squashes.
 * If the PR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description.
