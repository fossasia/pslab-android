NonInverting Op-Amp

### Study Op-Amps : Non-Inverting configuration

* Non Inverting amplifier is one in which the output is in phase with respect to input. Output is an Non Inverted amplified version of input.

* Assuming the opamp is ideal and applying the concept of virtual short, the voltage at the inverting terminal is equal to non inverting terminal.

* Make the Connections as shown in the figure.

* CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.

* CH2 monitors the amplifier output. 

* Observe various gains by changing Rf/Ri Ratio.

* If gain is greater than 2x , reduce the input waveform amplitude by turning the amplitude knob next to W1 so that the output voltage does not exceed limits.

* Enter Resistance values in the following boxes and click to calculate the theoretical gain.
