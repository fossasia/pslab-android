    Make the connections as shown in the figure<br>
    Select a voltage at PV1, for setting collector voltage. <br>
    For various equally spaced voltages in the specified range, the collector current is measured as a function of base current.<br>
    An ammeter is not shown , but base current is calculated using the measured voltage drop across the known resistor. I = (PV2-CH3)/200k
