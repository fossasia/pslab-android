### Experiments with a lemon cell

#### Measure the voltage of a lemon cell

* Make the connections as shown in the figure. Use a copper wire, and a galvanized(coated with zinc) nail as the two electrodes. 
* Observe the voltmeter for CH1 ,and note the values . Also observe, that the graph for CH1 is a straight line. This is because the voltage is constant.

#### Measure the internal resistance of a lemon cell

* The purpose of this section is to understand why the lemon cell is not adequate to supply high currents.
* Connect a 1000 (1K) Ohm resistor across the lemon cell, and observe that the voltage has now reduced.

* This is a consequence of the internal resistance of the lemon cell, and using the measured voltage difference caused by connecting this resistor, we can calculate it.
* The current flowing through the circuit with the load resistor connected, according to Ohm's law, is I = V/R = V(CH1)/1000 .
* The voltage drop = ( V(CH1) without R connected - V(CH1) with R connected ) 
* Internal resistance = voltage drop/current(I)

* Connect three lemon cells in series, and note the voltage. Try connecting an LED to this battery.
