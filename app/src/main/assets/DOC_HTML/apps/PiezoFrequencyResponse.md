	<h3>Bandwidth Characterization of a piezo buzzer</h3>
	image pending<br>

	Connect W1 to the buzzer's +ve wire, as well as CH2 for monitoring the original waveform.<br>
	Connect a microphone to MIC, and put about ten cms gap between the buzzer and microphone.<br>
	Set the frequency range to study the behaviour in, and click on START .<br><br>
	In case the MIC output starts clipping(flattened peaks) around the peak amplitude, decrease buzzer volumne using the amplitude knob
