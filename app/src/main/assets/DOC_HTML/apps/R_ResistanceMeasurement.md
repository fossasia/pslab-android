* As shown in the figure, on connecting the resistor between SEN pin and GND pin, you can measure the resistance value of the resistor in Ohm units.

* Resistance of any circuit can be measured using this device. Just connect the starting and ending point of the circuit between this wires and you can measure the net resistance value of the circuit.

* NOTE: In case of measuring resistance of a resistor, the resistor can be connected in any manner with this wires as resistor doesn't have positive and negative polarities.

* Two types of configuration are possible when measuring resistive circuit which are:

### Series Resistive Circuit

* In this type of configuration, resistors are placed side by side and thus the net resistance of the circuit equals to the sum of individual resistance of each resistor.

### Parallel Resistive Circuit

* In this type of configuration, resistors are placed in such a way that both the ends of all resistors in the circuit are joined to common ends respectively. Thus, the net resistance of the circuit can be found out by the following formula
