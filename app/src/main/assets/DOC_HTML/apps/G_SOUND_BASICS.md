	<h3>Record sound using the microphone, and study frequencies</h3>

	<h3>DC resistance</h3>
    In this experiment, the signals recorded by the microphone will be plotted as a function of time in the first graph.<br>
    If a fixed frequency sound, such as a whistle, or a plucked string is recorded, its frequency will be mathematically extracted, and shown at the top<br>
    The second plot shows a fourier transform of the recorded data. The X-Axis of the graph is frequency,<br>and the Y-Axis displays the amplitude of sound corresponding to that frequency.<br>
    Try Mixing different frequencies (Two people can whistle together) , and see how the original whistles can be extracted from the mixed input signal.<br>
