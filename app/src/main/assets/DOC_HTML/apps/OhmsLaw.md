	<img src="images/ohms.svg" width="100%"><br>

	Make the Connections as shown in the figure.<br>
	CH1 monitors the Voltage across the resistor.<br>
	PCS sets a suitable current flow through the resistor .<br><br>
	Calculate the voltage across the resistor for various different currents, and plot them.<br><br>
	
	Do Not use high value resistors, because the current source will not be able adjust to such high levels to ensure the right amount of current flow.<br>
	up to 200 ohms is ideal
