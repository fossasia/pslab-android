### Diode I-V Characteristics

![](file:///android_asset/DOC_HTML/apps/images/schematics/diodeIV.svg@100%|auto)

* Connect the Diode from CH3 to Ground.
* Connect a 1k resistor from PV1 to CH3.

* PV1 is varied in steps, and for each step the current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH3, and the known value of the resistor.
* Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.
