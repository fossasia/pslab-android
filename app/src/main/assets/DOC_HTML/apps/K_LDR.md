	<h3>Light Dependent Resistor</h3>
	<br>An LDR is a two pin device whose resistance decreases with the intensity of light falling on it.<br><br>

	<h3>Record 50Hz fluctuations caused by flourescent lighting</h3>
	Set up the device in a room with flourescent lighting, and observe that the plot fluctuates slightly. Zoom in along the vertical axis by scrolling on the yaxis at the level of the plot<br>
	Now pause the data updates, and use the crosshairs to calculate the time period of the fluctuations. Confirm that they correspond to the power line frequency.<br><br>
	
	<h3>Testing with a flickering LED</h3>
	Repeat the same with an LED connected between SQR1 and GND. Set the frequency , and point it towards the LDR.<br>
	Measure the time period again, and confirm that it corresponds to the frequency of SQR1 that was set<br>
