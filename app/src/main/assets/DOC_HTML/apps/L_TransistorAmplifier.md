	Make the Connections as shown in figure (A).<br>
	CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.<br>
	CH2 monitors the amplifier output .<br><br>
	Change the value of PV3, and observe its effect on the output.<br><br>

	Restore PV3 to 1.65V, and make the Connections as shown in figure (B).<br>
	CH1 monitors the EMF induced in the speaker's coil due to external vibrations . The speaker effectively functions as a microphone here.<br>
	Connect a piezo buzzer to W1, and set the frequency to around 3600Hz at which it resonates, and is loudest.<br>
