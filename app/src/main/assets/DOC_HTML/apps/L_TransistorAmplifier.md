*	Make the Connections as shown in figure (A).
*	CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.
*	CH2 monitors the amplifier output .
*	Change the value of PV3, and observe its effect on the output.

*	Restore PV3 to 1.65V, and make the Connections as shown in figure (B).
*	CH1 monitors the EMF induced in the speaker's coil due to external vibrations . The speaker effectively functions as a microphone here.
*	Connect a piezo buzzer to W1, and set the frequency to around 3600Hz at which it resonates, and is loudest.
