Amplitude Modulation
---

### Perform the amplitude modulation over signals.
#### Introduction:

* Modulation is defined as the process by which some characteristics of a carrier signal is varied in accordance with a modulating signal.

* Amplitude modulation is defined as the process in which the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied about a means values linearly with the base band signal.

* The carrier frequency fc must be much greater than the highest frequency components fm of the message signal m(t) i.e. fc>>fm.

* The modulation index must be less than unity.

#### Schematic:

* The circuit connection is made as shown in the circuit.

* Two signal generators are used in this circuit, one representing a high frequency RF carrier, the other signal generator is used to inject a 1KHz audio signal. 

* The two signals are mixed and amplified by the transistor and an amplitude modulated signal appears at the collector of the BC108. 

* The DC component is removed and the RF output now appears across the load resistor R1.
