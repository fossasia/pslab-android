### Make an AC generator using a magnet and a coil

* Make the connections to the solenoid as shown in the figure.

* Now rotate a magnet on the plane containing its magnetic axis, and bring the solenoid close to it such that its axis is also parallel to this plane. Use the picture shown as a reference.

* Observe the plot of the induced EMF, and calculate its time period. This time period should correspond to the RPM of the magnet.

* You may also mount the magnet on a dc motor in order to rotate it at a fairly constant speed. 

* Now monitor the induced waveform using the oscilloscope, and use the sine fit function to extractthe frequency of the waveform. This should correspond with the rotational frequency of the magnet

* Use the stroboscopic effect to verify that the motor is indeed spinning at this frequency.
