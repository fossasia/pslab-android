### Study a fullwave rectifier using the sine wave generators

* Full wave rectifiers combine the positive halves of 180 degree out of phase input waveforms such as those output from AC transformers with a center tap.

* The rectified signal can be further filtered with a capacitor in order to obtain a low ripple DC voltage.

* In case a transformer is not available, the sine wave generators of the PSLab can be to the same frequency, but with 180 degree phase difference in order to behave like one.

* Two diodes are used to clip out the negative parts of both inputs, and combine them into a single output which is always in the positive region.
