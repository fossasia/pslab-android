Op-Amps : Colpitts Oscillator
---
#### Introduction

* The Colpitts Oscillator design uses two centre-tapped capacitors in series with a parallel inductor to form its resonance tank circuit producing sinusoidal oscillations

* The Colpitts oscillator uses a capacitive voltage divider network as its feedback source. The two capacitors, C1 and C2 are placed across a single common inductor L1 . Then C1, C2 and L1 form the tuned tank circuit with the condition for oscillations being: XC1 + XC2 = XL1.
