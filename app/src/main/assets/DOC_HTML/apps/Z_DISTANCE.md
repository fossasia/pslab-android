Ultrasonic Range Finder
---

* This sensor measures distances to flat surfaces placed in front of it by bouncing sound pulses off it, and measuring the round trip delay.
* It first emits a high frequency sound (40KHz) , and starts a stopwatch. This emitted sound pulse reflects off the nearest object, and returns to the sensor, which immediately stops the stopwatch.
* Using the known speed of sound, and the measured time delay, the distance travelled by the sound pulse is calculated. The distance to the object is half of this value.

### Measuring time period of a pendulum
* Place an oscillating flat object in front of this sensor, such as a blackboard duster suspended by a string, and measure its time period from the plot.
