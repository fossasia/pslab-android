	Make the Connections as shown in the figure.<br>
	CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.<br>
	CH2 monitors the filtered waveform .<br><br>
	PV3 is used as the voltage source that controls the roll-off frequency. It must be set to a minimum of 500mV .<br> The roll-off frequency increases with PV3<br>
	Select the frequency range over which to study this circuit ( 10-1000Hz ) is adequate, and click on start.
