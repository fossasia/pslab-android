* Make the connections to the solenoid as shown in the figure.

* Now set the frequency of W1 to 1KHz . The oscillating potential difference across coil A , also called the primary,
results in an oscillating magnetic field.

* Now place the second coil , the secondary, in front of the primary coil such that their magnetic axes are aligned.

* Observe the induced EMF in the secondary, and its correlation to the primary. Try reversing the solenoid direction.

* Confirm that a fixed magnetic field does not induce a voltage, and that the induced voltage is proportional to changing fields only. You can do this by connecting the primary to PV1 rather than W1, and setting a voltage on it.
