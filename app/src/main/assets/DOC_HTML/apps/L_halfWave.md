Half-Wave Rectifier
---

### Study a halfwave rectifier using a sine wave generator

* Half wave rectifiers clip out the negative part of the input waveform. The rectified signal can be further filtered with a capacitor in order to obtain a low ripple DC voltage.

* Only a diode is needed to clip out the negative part of the input signal.

* Make the Connections as shown in the figure.

* CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.

* CH2 monitors the rectified waveform .

* Connect a load resistor to remove noise from the output.

* To observe the effect of filtering, connect a capacitor to GND.

* Connect various capacitors to study how their values affect the output signal.
