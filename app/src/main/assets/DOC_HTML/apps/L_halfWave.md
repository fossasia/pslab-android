Half-Wave Rectifier
---

### Study a halfwave rectifier using a sine wave generator

* Half wave rectifiers clip out the negative part of the input waveform. The rectified signal can be further filtered with a capacitor in order to obtain a low ripple DC voltage.

* Only a diode is needed to clip out the negative part of the input signal.
