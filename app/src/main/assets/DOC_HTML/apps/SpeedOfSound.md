* Make the Connections as shown in the figure
* The Ultrasonic Range Finder HC-SR04 measures the distance of an obstacle from the sensor 
* It first emits a high frequency sound (40 kHz) , and starts a timer. This emitted sound pulse reflects off the nearest object, and returns to the sensor,
   which immediately stops the timer.
* Using the known distance, and the measured time delay, the speed of sound pulse is calculated
